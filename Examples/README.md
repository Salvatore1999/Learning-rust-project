# Examples

In this folder, I'll put all the examples I make to better understand rust code, starting with the simple ones and then (hopefully) moving on to more complex and complex examples.

I think we also include something comparative with C++, which is my "native language".

It differs from the "Projects" directory because I'll put entire projects in that folder based in part on these examples, but the point is that such projects are something that can exist on their own.
