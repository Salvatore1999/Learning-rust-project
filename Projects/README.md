# Projects

In this folder, I'll put all the projects I make, starting with the simple ones and then (hopefully) moving on to more complex and complex projects.

I think we also include something comparative with C++, which is my "native language".

It differs from the "Examples" directory because in that folder, I'll only put simple sinppets or something that might be useful for projects, not an entire project.
