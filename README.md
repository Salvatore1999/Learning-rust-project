# Learning Rust

I'm a C++ programmer starting to learn Rust from scratch.

This repository is my personal space to experiment, take notes, and build small projects while learning.

## Why this project is public

I decided to make this repository public because I want it to become a **friendly guide for anyone learning Rust from zero**, just like me.

In this repo I will share:

 - Every useful resource I find online
 - All the exercises, examples, and small projects I write
 - Code **always commented in English**
 - Explanations and notes written in a simple and informal way

If you're also starting your Rust journey, feel free to explore, use the examples, and even suggest improvements.

## Goals

Goals are the common goals a beginner might have:

 - Understand Rust fundamentals
 - Practice writing **idiomatic** Rust code  
 - Compare Rust and C++ approaches to common problems (I should be able to do that, I hope)  
 - Document every step of the learning process
 - Build a small reference for beginners approaching Rust

## Repository Structure

The repository will grow over time. Planned structure:

 - /Examples   → small snippets exploring specific Rust features
 - /Projects   → mini‑projects and experiments
 - /Notes      → personal notes, explanations, comparisons
 - /Resources  → useful links, articles, videos, and books

## Contributions

This is mainly a personal learning project, but **suggestions**, **improvements** and **new resources** are all welcome!

Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request, I will be happy for that!

## Final note

Rust is a completely new world for me, but I want to document the journey step by step.
If this helps even one other person starting from zero… then mission accomplished!
